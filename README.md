## üìç Overview
Ecoins is an innovative, multi-platform application available on IOS, Android, and Web, designed to educate and engage users in the concept of waste management through an immersive and gamified experience. The primary objective of Ecoins is to raise awareness about the importance of recycling and proper waste disposal practices.

The game within Ecoins revolves around various items commonly found in our daily lives, such as plastics, metals, paper, cardboard, and more. Players are tasked with the responsibility of sorting these items correctly to maximize recycling efficiency. By successfully segregating the items, players earn valuable in-game resources like sun and water power-ups, which symbolize the renewable energy sources used in recycling processes.

As the game progresses, the complexity and difficulty level dynamically increase, presenting players with more challenging scenarios that require strategic decision-making and quick thinking. The aim is to simulate real-life waste management situations and encourage players to adopt environmentally friendly habits in their daily lives.

Ecoins not only provides an entertaining gaming experience but also serves as an educational platform. Throughout the game, players receive informative tips and facts about waste management, recycling techniques, and the positive impact of responsible waste disposal. By blending entertainment with education, Ecoins aims to empower individuals to make conscious choices and contribute to a sustainable future.

With its cross-platform compatibility, Ecoins ensures that players can access and enjoy the game seamlessly across multiple devices, making it easily accessible to a wide range of users. By incorporating gamification and interactive elements, Ecoins aims to make waste management engaging, enjoyable, and accessible to users of all ages, fostering a sense of responsibility and environmental consciousness in the process.
